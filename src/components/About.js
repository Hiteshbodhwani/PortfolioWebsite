      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Hitesh Bodhwani</strong>, a passionate frontend developer with a focus on building fast, responsive, and modern web applications using <strong>React.js</strong> and the <strong>MERN stack</strong>. I enjoy translating ideas into elegant, user-friendly interfaces and optimizing performance to deliver seamless user experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        I recently completed my <strong>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)</strong> with a specialization in <strong>Data Science</strong> from Career Point University, Kota (2022–2025), and I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects and contribute to impactful development teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve built full-stack apps, worked on REST APIs, and constantly strive to write clean, maintainable code. I’m currently expanding my knowledge in cloud deployment and UI design systems.
